# ElegansGermline
An add-on project for the Chaste biological modelling library (https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac). Allows the user to run 3D mechanics simulations of the C. elegans germline, a system used to study stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Also includes code for a tube shaped boundary formed along the path of a leader cell, and support for cell cycle models controlled by a statechart.
